How to Run the Program
	
	Before you run the .sh files, you need to change the paths of output.txt in the scripts:
	-1)basic.cpp		line176 
	-2)basic.sh		line2
	-3)efficient.cpp		line249
	-4)efficient.sh		line2
	

	When you run the .sh files, the program needs you to input the path of your input.txt.
	e.g.	/Users/pengjingyan/Desktop/test570/input.txt
